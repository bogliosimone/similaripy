# ðŸ“Œ Getting Started

SimilariPy provides **high-performance KNN similarity functions** in Python, optimized for sparse matrices.

Primarily designed for Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, but can be applied to other domains as well.

The package also includes a set of normalization functions useful for pre-processing data in-place before the similarity computation.

## Similarity Functions

SimilariPy provides a range of high-performance similarity functions for sparse matrices.  
All functions are multi-threaded and implemented in Cython + OpenMP for fast parallel computation on CSR matrixes.

### Core 

- **Dot Product** â€“ Simple raw inner product between vectors.
- **Cosine** â€“ Normalized dot product based on L2 norm.
- **Asymmetric Cosine** â€“ Skewed cosine similarity using an `alpha` parameter.
- **Jaccard**, **Dice**, **Tversky** â€“ Set-based generalized similarities.

### Graph-Based

- **P3Î±** â€“ Graph-based similarity computed through random walk propagation with exponentiation.
- **RP3Î²** â€“ Similar to P3Î± but includes popularity penalization using a `beta` parameter.

### Advanced 

- **S-Plus** â€“ A hybrid model combining Tversky and Cosine components, with full control over weights and smoothing.

## Normalization Functions

SimilariPy provides a suite of normalization functions for sparse matrix pre-processing.  
All functions are implemented in Cython and can operate in-place on CSR matrixes for maximum performance and memory efficiency.

- **L1, L2** â€“ Applies row- or column-wise normalization.
- **TF-IDF** â€“ Computes TF-IDF weighting with customizable term-frequency and IDF modes.
- **BM25** â€“ Applies classic BM25 weighting used in information retrieval.
- **BM25+** â€“ Variant of BM25 with additive smoothing for low-frequency terms.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a minimal example to get you up and running with SimilariPy:


```python
import similaripy as sim
import scipy.sparse as sps

# Create a random User-Rating Matrix (URM)
urm = sps.random(1000, 2000, density=0.025)

# Normalize the URM using BM25
urm = sim.normalization.bm25(urm)

# Train an item-item cosine similarity model
similarity_matrix = sim.cosine(urm.T, k=50)

# Compute recommendations for user 1, 14, 8 
# filtering out already-seen items
recommendations = sim.dot_product(
    urm,
    similarity_matrix.T,
    k=100,
    target_rows=[1, 14, 8],
    filter_cols=urm
)
```

Tips:

- `urm.T` is used to switch from user-item to item-user when training the similarity model.
- You can use `bm25plus`, `tfidf`, or `normalize` for different pre-processing strategies.
- All operations are multithreaded and scale with available CPU cores.
